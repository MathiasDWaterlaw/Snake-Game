Just an exercise i've take with the help of freeCodeCamp's YouTube Channel:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyhzCBEGaBY

the game is still a bit buggy, but i've manage to fix some issues that the "original" game, in the freeCodeCamp's video, has like:

- 1 in this version you can pause the game, at any times, by pressing 'p'
- 2 in this version the snake can't reverse is position causing the reset of the game (if you're going right - you can't going left, if you're going up you - can't going down, etc.)

There is an annoying bug that make the food appear sometimes in the snake's body. I will try in future to fix that to.
